Pope Amaham is killed and reborn as Godking.

In [[Loháven]], God Priest [[Amaham]] is assasinated

[...] Redacted

Pope [[Amaham]] would rise again, as Amaham the Immortal. His body did pass, but his spirit latched to another. Some mystics say this previously ‘other’ was in fact Amaham’s younger self, though this is widely disputed. In taverns across the land you might hear it was in fact Amaham’s lost illegitimate son that unwillingly gave his body to the Godking, though the church repents such an accusation. No one really knows, but the church insists it was a man of the common folk, a man with great faith and a fearless heart.
