The party sets off in the footsteps of a legend in search of the biography
</span>
The party departs [[Ghostlight]] on their hunt for [[The Biography]]. On the way the pass by [[The Murky Throne]] and pick up some breathing devices. On their way to the north side of [[Ashenfell]], the party passes by a sinking ship. Onboard the ship is [[Bonk]], a troll with a giant appetite. The party leaves [[The Emerald Marauder]] and starts their climb of [[The Maw]].

After multiple days of arduous climbing, the party finally reaches the Mausoleum, 15 km up [[The Maw]]. Murals outside the entrance show how [[Durgan Torason]] wrestles with sea serpents, journeys with pirates, and fights alongside divine champions. One of the murals include [[Captain Marrowveil]].  Inside the temple the party finds three piedestals, each with a slot for a key. The party must gather these keys by solving the puzzles of the mausoleum.

The party assembles one key by cross referencing a room of paintings with the murals outside. Only two paintings align with the murals outside and so those pieces are chosen.

The party overcomes additional challenges and puzzles, acquiring materials to forge another key into a mold. The third key had to be forged by first symbolically sacrificing the crown of the [[Dur'Gurn]] throne.

After besting the challenges of Durgan, another test awaited. The avatar of [[Torag]] tested the virtue and mettle of the party. Amongst other tests, Torag, resurrected [[Vissariss]] to test if the party would dispense justice again. After passing the trials of Torag, the party finds the treasure room of [[Durgan Torason]]. [[Bob the Balchemist]] is first to find [[The Biography]], and learns that Durgan was in reality a sentient man of stone. [[Nazromir]] and [[Robert Sköld]] loot the armory and Nazromir finds a painting of [[Durgan Torason]] reaching for a jewel at the bottom of the sea. The jewel is plucked out of the paiting by Nazromir and revealed to be [[The Sunken Jewel of Elghinn]]. Besides [[The Biography]] lays some miscellaneous items (including a  feather from Iomedae's wings!!!). Nazromir identifies the pouch of herbs as coming from [[Veloria]].

The party returns to the labyrinth to see how [[Bonk]] is doing, last they left him he and the minotaur where stuck in a eternal battle fueled by regeneration. [[Bonk]] has mutated from the trauma, growing more powerful, along with an additional head. Afterwards, they make their way back down to where they left their ship. They return just in time to find that their ship is being plundered. After killing the pirates they find a letter stating that [[Besmara]] has declare pirate-law, meaning that no pirates may attack each other. She also orders everyone to gather on the west coast of [[Ashenfell]] to attack the fleet/blockade [[Loháven]] has put up.

The party sets off for [[Ghostlight]], on their way there Nazromir studies the charcoal drawing of a mountain range left by [[The Biography]]. He realises that that whilst he can not account for the mountain range being anyplace on the planet, the placement of the sun and shadows indicates that the drawing would depict something located around [[Mid-sea islands, Kailani]].
