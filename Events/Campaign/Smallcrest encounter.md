The Rivercock arrives in Smallcrest, only to find suspicious activity.
</span>
On arriving in [[Smallcrest]], [[Mayor Edwin]] is both disappointed and angry by the realization that 15-20 heavily armed soldiers are patrolling the village. The soldiers wear heavy armor with silver and yellow details, they all also carry the symbol of [[Anor]]. The soldiers are most likely members of [[The New Dawn]], drawing connections to [[The Orlande Tragedy]]. The soldier identify themselves as sent by the [[Colonizational Unit for National Tasks of Significance]]. 

The villagepeople have seemingly been restricted to their houses, or wiped out. Very few civilians are seen in the streets. Two soldiers take [[Nazromir]] and [[Robert Sköld]] to show them something but then attempt to backstab them. Roberts is cut down and Nazromir attempts to escape carrying Robert. Just as the soldiers strike down Nazromir they are crushed under a [[Living Bouder]], seemingly an act of pure divine intervention. As Nazromir looses conciousness he sees a vision of [[Rayleigh (Jirarn)]] running through the plains, he also once again hears that [[Mysterious Divine Language]]. Nazromir eventually awakes and manages to make his way back to [[The Rivercock]], carrying Robert on his back, where he finds [[Bob the Balchemist]] unconcious by a large river beast (Grauladon). With some effort he manages to get [[The Rivercock]] back in the river and sets of downstream. He finds three scrolls of *Heal* in the healers supplies and brings both Robert and Bob back to conciousness. In [[Mayor Edwin]]'s quarters he finds [[Mayor Edwin's Journal]], a *ring of minor arcana* and a *pendant of the occult*. The ship was also loaded with a suspicously large amount of manacles.
