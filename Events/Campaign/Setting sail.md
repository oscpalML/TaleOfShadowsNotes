The party dives into the murderous depths which the Vipers call home.
</span>
The party locates a hidden cove harboring a ship and supplies, the following letter is found.

**To Eberk Guldnacke,** 
>If you are reading this, then fate has unfolded in ways I had not wished, and I am unable to greet you in person. My deepest apologies for not being present to embark on this journey with you. The Vipers, ever a thorn in our side, learned of our quest and sought to extract its secrets from me. Though I evaded capture for a time, their persistence forced me into hiding, and ultimately, I have set sail to lead them away from Ashenfell, to protect our mission and ensure you could reach The Emerald Marauder without interference. 
>
>I leave The Emerald Marauder in your capable hands, trusting that you will find the lost biography of [[Durgan Torason]]. This ship has been more than just a vessel for me; it has been a companion through countless voyages and a keeper of untold secrets. She is swift, loyal, and enchanted to avoid unwelcome eyes. Treat her well, and she will guide you through the darkest storms and lead you to light. 
>
>Within this letter, you will find [[Biography Map|a map]], marked with the location where I believe the biography lies hidden. I believe this quest is not just a search for a book, but a journey to uncover a legacy. If you should find the [[Durgan Torason]]'s biography, guard it well, for many would seek to claim its power for themselves. I don't know what [[The Vipers]] want with it, but the fact that they want it must mean there is something more to it... 
>
>Remember, Eberk, the truest treasures are not of gold or gem, but of legacy. May the winds be ever in your favor, and may the shadows guide you in the absence of light. > >Farewell, my friend. May we meet again under better stars.


On their way to [[Ghostlight]], the party pass other settlements, such as [[Drunken Kraken]], and [[Raven's Roost]]. The party are suddenly attacked by what [[Nazromir]] recognizes as a Giant Squid. The squid is in heat and starts mating with the ship. [[Bob the Balchemist]] covers himself in spermwhale sperm, which he had carried since the start of his adventures.

Roberts shares that the leader of [[League of the Divine Wind]] was believed to be dead by him, his name was [[Isao Iinuma]].
