The party arrives in the haunted port of Ghostlight in search for treasures.
</span>

[[The Emerald Marauder]] arrives in [[Ghostlight]], being guided by the spectral wisps which give the town its name. The party is here in search of [[Captain Marrowveil]], the one who should hold the next clue of [[The Biography]]'s whereabouts.

[[Nazromir]] discovers the crooked hut of [[Ghostlight#Berit's Bobs and Baubles|Berit's Bobs and Baubles]]. The hag deals not in currency but rather trades, luckily she is not too sinister. In exchange for a kitchen-guiding magic item, the party takes up the quest to deliver a necklace to Berit's sister, the sea-hag [[Old Hag Fishbones]]. Her hut is south of town in a swamp-like area.

The party takes in at [[Ghostlight#Witchlight Inn|The Witchlight Inn]] in search of answers. Nazromir meets a wizard from [[Nólalóte]], [[Iramazz]], who was teleported to [[Ghostlight]] by mistake. The wizard and Nazromir get up to hijinks and end up throwing a fireball at the central lighthouse. The wizard scribes a scroll of Fireball for Nazromir.

The party finds out about the three ghosts which inhabit the central lighthouse [[Nazromir]] just fireball'd. They are known as [[The Elder Council]] and claim to rule [[Ghostlight]] but in reality have very little impact.

The party speaks with the bartender Melinda and hears rumors about a recent shipwreck down south which is allegedly haunted by now.  They also read about [[The Cult of Last Whispers]], a faction which wields the power of last words spoken before death. [[The Drowned Court]] is said to be a sea-faring faction of ghost who have a tendency to perform unwilling sacrifices. Finally, they find out that [[Captain Marrowveil]] is one of the three ghosts inhabiting the lighthouse.

The party infiltrates the lighthouse, posing as lighthouse repair-men, contracted to repair the lighthouse. They come to realise that ghosts have a poor grasp of time which aids their deception.

The lady-ghost is [[Lady Elowen]], she is constantly crying over the loss of her fiance Erik. They where on their way to [[Silveria]] for their honeymoon but their boat sank, attacked by some monster in a storm. Erik and she grew up in the same town as Lucian. [[Nazromir]] comforts her and gets invited to a memorial celebration in two days which the other ghosts will also attend. The third ghost is known as [[Thornwick]] and is a scholar or sage that resides in the basement.

The party fixes the lighthouse a little and then sets of to find [[Old Hag Fishbones]]. Once they find her hut they claim to be [[Okulta Konsulter Inc]] and she hires them for a quest to retrieve some bodies from a nearby shipwreck. The party discovers that the bodies are in fact cursed and therefore instead insist on giving them their last rites.

On the 11th, the party return to [[Old Hag Fishbones]], they intercept the entourage [[Prince Ribbitus Hexenwald III of the Murky Throne]]. The entourage and hag attack the party. The party slaughters them in response. In investigating the hut, the party learns that the hag has been active for around 40 years.

Once the party returns to [[Ghostlight]], they run into [[Lady Rosalind]]. Lady Rosalind is revealed to be a member of [[The Cult of Last Whispers]] and invites the party to visit [[The Vault of Voices]]. She invites Nazromir for a date and tries to make [[Bob the Balchemist]] her informant, both decline. 

The party breaks into the arcane-sealed cellar of the lighthouse and find the study of the grumpy sage ghost [[Thornwick]]. After being shunned the party attends the memorial ceremony along with the rest of [[The Elder Council]]. [[Robert Sköld]] and Nazromir share some details about their painful backgrounds. 

The morning thereafter, the 13th, the party sets off for [[The Vault of Voices]]. The cultist speak of how many ominous whispers have reached them, connected to the [[Smallcrest encounter]]. The cultists want to use [[Robert Sköld]] or Nazromir as conduits in a ritual to channel these last words. Robert attempts it but the ritual fails. The cultists state that they could re-attempt the ritual in a spiritually connected nexus, the lighthouse. 

In order to finish the lighthouse repairs, the party needs a lightsource. They come up with the idea of trapping a large number of ghostlights (the small glowing wisps) in a silver-mesh jar. 

On their way back to the lighthouse, Robert spots a pale hunched over figure in a dark cloak spying on them. When spotted he starts too flee. Nazromir gets up on the roof and spots him, he somewhat resembles a fletchling and has a crooked nose. 

The party gets back to [[The Emerald Marauder]] and Nazromir cooks up som Kraken-kebabs. During the night, Nazromir and [[Lucian]] are haunted by prophetic dreams. Nazromir dreams about [[Liliana]] and chasing after her, when he awakes, any attempts to seek divine guidance are drowned out by the buzzing of insects.  [[Lucian]] seeks the guidance of Nazromir in finding ones place in the cosmic balance. 

The party awakes on the 14th. Upon finishing the repairs of the lighthouse, [[Captain Marrowveil]] shares that [[Durgan Torason]] built his mausoleum high up on [[The Maw]]. He also shares that he and Durgan used to be good friends and that he knew Durgan to be in love with [[Iomedae]]. In celebration of the finished repairs, a party is arranged at the top of the lighthouse. [[Captain Marrowveil]] teaches the party the game of Captain's Horde. Linda and Pharah, two members of [[The Cult of Last Whispers]], join the party inconspicuously. Nazromir shares that the day is actually [[Liliana]]'s birthday and that he has prepared the pie he used to make for her. He shares the pie and some of his memories with [[Liliana]] with the party. Afterwards, the ritual to channel the last whispers originating from [[Smallcrest]], is re-attempted. The ritual reveals that [[Colonizational Unit for National Tasks of Significance]] and [[The New Dawn]] have been killing people in order to attempt to divine answers out of their last words. Some of the questions asked speak of [[Durgan Torason]]
