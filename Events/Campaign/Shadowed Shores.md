[[The Emerald Marauder]] arrives in [[Ghostlight]], being guided by the spectral wisps which give the town its name. The party is here in search of [[Captain Marrowveil]], the one who should hold the next clue of [[The Biography]]'s whereabouts.

[[Nazromir]] discovers the crooked hut of [[Ghostlight#Berit's Bobs and Baubles|Berit's Bobs and Baubles]]. The hag deals not in currency but rather trades, luckily she is not too sinister. In exchange for a kitchen-guiding magic item, the party takes up the quest to deliver a necklace to Berit's sister, the sea-hag [[Old Hag Fishbones]]. Her hut is south of town in a swamp-like area.

The party takes in at [[Ghostlight#Witchlight Inn]] in search of answers. Nazromir meets a wizard from [[Nólalóte]], [[Iramazz]], who was teleported to [[Ghostlight]] by mistake. The wizard and Nazromir get up to hijinks and end up throwing a fireball at the central lighthouse. The wizard scribes a scroll of Fireball for Nazromir.

The party finds out about the three ghosts which inhabit the central lighthouse [[Nazromir]] just fireball'd. They are known as [[The Elder Council]] and claim to rule [[Ghostlight]] but in reality have very little impact.

The party speaks with the bartender Melinda and hears rumors about a recent shipwreck down south which is allegedly haunted by now.  They also read about [[The Cult of Last Whispers]], a faction which wields the power of last words spoken before death. [[The Drowned Court]] is said to be a sea-faring faction of ghost who have a tendency to perform unwilling sacrifices. Finally, they find out that [[Captain Marrowveil]] is one of the three ghosts inhabiting the lighthouse.

The party infiltrates the lighthouse, posing as lighthouse repair-men, contracted to repair the lighthouse. They come to realise that ghosts have a poor grasp of time which aids their deception.

The lady-ghost is [[Lady Elowen]], she is constantly crying over the loss of their fiance Erik. They where on their way to [[Silveria]] for their honeymoon but their sank, attacked by some monster in a storm. Erik and she grew up in the same town as Lucian. [[Nazromir]] comforts her and gets invited to a memorial celebration in two days which the other ghosts will also attend. The third ghost is known as [[Thornwick]]

The party fixes the lighthouse a little and then sets of to find [[Old Hag Fishbones]]. The
