#### The Search for Sarah
Nazromir starts discreetly inquiring about [[Scorn]]. He learns about [[Vissariss]], a half dragon woman who leads a gang (the Vipers) who always gets their way.

The party follows a series of clues to [[Sarah Steelheart]]'s whereabouts.

>"You of the whirlpool three, heed my call, follow the song of the Siren's Lament, where ash dances with water. Listen to the tales of the fellow three-headed serpent, and his whispers of betrayal long ago." - _Love, S_

The party meets three figures in the Sirens Lament tavern. A half-ogre, a serpentfolk and a frog. The half-ogre brandishes the symbol of [[Triskelion]]. 

>Ythné den enögde vArrr i hans egna ord sin tids största pirat. Han plundrade och bedrog värre än någon annan, och hade alltid över sin karriär vunnit ett skepp fler än han förlorat. Men både var i stortal. En kväll, i hopp om att binda band med en annan piratkung, glömde Ythné en pirats viktigaste band - det till hans besättning. För att behaga denna andra piratkungen bjöd han på ljuva skatter, skatter som rättmätligt skulle delats med hans besättning istället. Och när han tittade åt sin vän piratkungen med vänster öga, missade hans lappade höger matronernas hämnd! De tillfångatog Ythne den Enögde, och hängde han, uppe på Hangman's hill.

>Han velarr där än idag i spöklig gestalt, om hans missöde och orättvisan bakom det. Lyssna till hans visdom, och fråga om det sanna priset för en andra chans.

The party makes their way to Hangman hill where they manage to summon the ghost of Ythné, who offers the next clue. 

>"Det sanna priset för en andra chans... En uppoffring av stolthet, ett hjärtas åtrå bytt mot ödmjukhetens omfamning. Betala det inte i guld eller blod, men i viskat erkännande av dåtida misstag, under stjärnornas kalla dom."

>_"Where day meets night, and shadow dances with lantern's light, where whispers strike deals in the unseen, your Sara lies in hiding. Watch out for the Whisperer's temptations, the wraith stalking its street. His currency is most foul, your soul his receipt."_ 

>_The market is found in Sable square, where talent is laid most bare. Look for the shaded hand of the dueler, and you will find the market of far more than a jeweler_

The party finds a mural on Sable Square which teleports one to midnight market after offering up  a coin. 

>A marketplace that lies in a disorienting network of sparse and low-roofed caves. The cave is often filled with mist, and the roof clad with violet crystals making it ominously nocturnal. Only accessible to those who know the secret entrance, the market offers a wide array of illegal and rare items, from cursed relics to forbidden tomes. Shadows dance slowly here, with eerie flickering lanterns as whispers of dangerous deals fill the air.

Det ryktas om någon som kallas [[The Whisperer]], ryktet går han är en djävul. 

#### Attack on the Midnight Auction
There is a large auction in the middle of the market. The first item auctioned is The Eye of Nyx, a relic supposedly stolen from the church. It has the power to find whatever or whomever on is searching for. A hulking insect-like humanoid moves up through the crowd and places a bet for [[Vissariss]]. A sudden flash of light followed by smoke fills the room as the vendor is found dead with the relic stolen. The party follows the assassain and kills him before he is able to finish of [[Sarah Steelheart]].

#### The Dare Pirates Treasure
Partyt tar sig till Powder town och tar in på Charred Rose Tavern. Tavernan är känd för sin livliga atmosfär. Blir approachade av en figur med mörka fläckar över sin hud. Han bär en huva med mysterisk atmosfär. Han har kommit över en karta över katakomber utanför innerstaden, där det sägs ligga några pirater med deras skatt. 

Skatten tillhör The Dare Pirates. Lead by the charismatic captain Darealia. 

Nazromir tar med Cursed Rib and Finger Of The Pirate Lord. 
#### Sarah's Story
[[Sarah Steelheart|Sarah]] tells the story of why she is hunted by [[The Vipers]]. [[Sarah Steelheart|Sarah]] met a man, [[Borial]], who convinced her to fight for the greater good. They decided to take down [[The Vipers]] and [[Vissariss]]. On the 10th of January, they infiltrated a Viper base located by [[Blighthollow#Hagfoot Bridge|Hagfoot Bridge]], a warehouse used to store contraband. Their mission was to plant false evidence of a internal plot to overthrow Visarys, in order to incite in-fighting. After they had planted the evidence, [[Sarah Steelheart|Sarah]] snuck closer to [[Vissariss]] and overhead a conversation with some churchly person, she overhears the name "[[Goliander Starchild]]":

>"The deaaaal was to kill him and leave nothing of hissss body for his soul to return to... We upheld that contract..." 
>"-You won't slither yourself out of this, snake! Do not forget your reward is dependant on our Lord's ascension. By this covenant we are still bound, regardless of the former technicality. Do not forget this, [[Vissariss]] - and your treasure will be yours eventually... ?The Sunrise Legion? will contact you *Sara knocks over plank* ... What was that?"

[[Borial]] is captured but Sarah manages to escape. [[Sarah Steelheart|Sarah]] is certain that [[Borial]]
is dead but can not confirm it.

The churchly person bears a resemblance to the person in the painting in the Starchild Estate at [[Killian Peak]]. The party suspects that this person is [[Goliander Starchild]]. 

The party asks about the other factions on the island and learn about [[The Dark Dagger Veils]]. They are a more traditional hitman-group, one which despises the recklessness and unprofessional [[The Vipers]]. The party also learns about [[The Hooded Lanterns]], the faction to which [[Borial]] belonged, a faction which tries to be good and provide people with a second chance. 
#### The Search for Scorn
The party sets out to find [[Scorn]]. They encounter a mysterious soothsayer with four arms and ashy grey lifeless skin. The mans malformations reminds of those caused by [[Udún]]'s influence. [[Nazromir]] trades [[Rayleigh]]'s finger for information about Scorn. The soothsayer speaks about Scorn being bound and soon to arrive to the harbor. 

In the harbor, the giant church-owned man-o-war [[Anastara]] arrives to port. [[Aurelia]], [[Lucian]]'s twin sister, is at the helm. Inside is [[Scorn]], bound by radiant manacles. Scorn whispers to a shadow apparated by [[Lucian]] to meet him at [[Blighthollow#The Necrodancer|The Necrodancer]]. [[Scorn]] is lead out in chains and ordered to lead towards "them". [[Aurelia]] converses with local pirate kings and alleges that the ship is only there for a day. 

[[Nazromir]], fearing that Scorn would be taken away once more, starts to incite a rebellion from the local pirates. Tasking them with blowing up the fancy church ship. [[Gråe-Tom]] is particularly excited by the plan.
#### Killing Unkillable Vibes
It is the 5th of February.

The party arrives early to [[Blighthollow#The Necrodancer|The Necrodancer]], setting up a potential ambush. The owner, necromancer and DJ of the club is [[Ophelia]], who wears a purple dress whilst blasting out tunes from behind the DJ booth. 

[[Aurelia]] and her entourage enters the club. [[Lucian]] presents himself, pretending to live on the island. Scorn signals to [[Ophelia]] and a fight breaks out. During the fight, [[Lucian]] attempts to devour the bindings around Scorn but struggles with the nature of the darkness inside him, temporarily losing control. The paladins are slaughtered.

#### Scorn's Story
In [[Iomedar]], [[Scorn]] tried to reach out to old contacts. He found out that there would be a large movement of people, [[Ylladin]] amongst them. He infiltrated the palace and got as far as [[Amaham]]'s room before being captured by a spell. 

Scorn travels to [[Iomedar]]. He intends to spy. However, after some weeks with no progress he gets news that they're about to leave somewhere imminently. He throws caution to the wind, and instead intends to bluntly confront [[Amaham]]/[[Gust]]. Ask him what happened, and use force if necessary.

- Scorn is able to infiltrate the palace, and almost gets to [[Amaham]]'s room. However, he is stopped by [[Ylladin]].
- The door to his quarters opens, and Scorn sees his friend, darkened by the rooms shadows, turn around and look him in the eye.
- He is taken captive. Realizing he may have something to to with the assassination attempt, he is questioned. He is questioned by [[Aurelia]], as the others leave.
- Scorn realizes the blind goodness in [[Aurelia]] and plays into this. He speaks truthfully about [[Gust]]/[[Amaham]] being his previous friend, which [[Aurelia]] of course reads as confusion. He goes on, and wishes to simply return to his friends. lures his captors to [[Blighthollow]], where he "admits" the rest of his crew is located. This party is led by [[Aurelia]], since [[Ylladin]] at this time is predisposed in [[The Scarlet Crusade]].

[[Nazromir]] tells [[Scorn]] everything, [[Scorn]] is open to helping taking down [[The Vipers]] and rallying the rest of [[The Scales]] towards [[The New Dawn]]. 

#### The Insurrectionist
The undead ogre bouncer comes down, asking for "The Slayer of Visarys". The one asking is [[Kraxia]], the lieutenant which [[Sarah Steelheart|Sarah]] tried to frame. Turns out the fake plans where real and [[Kraxia]] wants to kill [[Vissariss]]. [[Kraxia]] tells the party about a temple to [[Achaekek]] south east of town which serves as [[The Vipers]] headquarters. 

#### Infiltrating the Temple
On the 6th, the party heads for the temple where [[Kraxia]] presses the symbol of a bat to enter the secret passagway.
