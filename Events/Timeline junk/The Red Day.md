Pope Amaham is killed and reborn as Godking.

In [[Loháven]], God Priest [[Amaham]] is assassinated

Pope [[Amaham]] would rise again, as Amaham the Immortal. His body did pass, but his spirit latched to another. Some mystics say this previously ‘other’ was in fact Amaham’s younger self, though this is widely disputed. In taverns across the land you might hear it was in fact Amaham’s lost illegitimate son that unwillingly gave his body to the Godking, though the church repents such an accusation. No one really knows, but the church insists it was a man of the common folk, a man with great faith and a fearless heart.

[[Gust and Nazromir's mission]] saw the events of The Red Day. 

It is speculated by the party that [[The Vipers]] where contracted by [[The New Dawn]], or at least [[Goliander Starchild]], to assassinate [[Amaham]] during The Red Day.  The role of [[Ylladin]] remains uncertain. Since he was crying during the observed massacre it is possible that he was mind-controlled or forced to go berserk, perhaps as a distraction or as a means of assassination directly.
