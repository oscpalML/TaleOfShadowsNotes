# Wish upon a rock
![[Pasted image 20240419220102.png|200]]
In the beginning of the dwarven empires, when the mountains were young, there lived a hero. The hero *He* was not *I*, for *He* was my father, [[Tora Ironfist]], *the greatest dwarf that ever lived*. He led the dwarven tribes, and founded the first dwarven empire, [[Behl’Gurn]], in [[Dur'Gurn]]'s green rock. And while his achievements were carved in stone, his legacy was not. My mother and father could not produce an heir, their first being stillborn - cold as the earth in which they lived. Failing them even before I was born, it seemed I was not to be. In despair my father prayed. He prayed to the pendant he had carved me, a little black-rock hero for his future son, and to the Father of Dwarvenkind, to set his lineage in stone. Wish it on the stone they say, you ever wondered why? 

It listens.

And so, I was brought into the world. Not by birth, but by my parents devotion all the same. The pendant, the little rock hero, was brought to life - and  *my legacy* began. 

# A rocky start
My youth was filled with expectations, being the heir to my father's throne - but also joy, snuck in between the moments. I was a rowdy child, sneaking off and exploring the caverns of our home, chewing ore and brawling with the cave spiders.

I was stronger than my peers - and hardier, being literally made of stone. Though few ever noticed, it seemed I was blessed by Torag to not look apart from others. Though I'm grateful - it likely saved me a great deal of pain and rejection - I feel that it also left my father blind to the reality of *me*. I wasn't me to him, I was an extension of him and his legacy. I always wanted to forge my own path, not simply fortify my father's castle. You could say I was being taken for granite. This rock felt stuck between his father and a hard place. Time to rock the boat. And I did, rock it that is. Being 200kg of rock has that effect on small vessels I found. I escaped my father's iron fist and set sails for new horizons, and all the adventures the world had to offer. - And I wasn't going to go easy. This was *my path*.

# Carving my own path
So, there I was, a dwarf of stone, journeying beyond the only world I’d ever known. Each step away from the empire of Behl’Gurn was like chiseling my destiny out of the bedrock of fate. I was searching for something—what, I couldn't exactly say. Freedom, perhaps? Or maybe just a chance to prove that I was more than my father's stone-crafted heir. The road was my forge, and the adventures, my hammer and anvil.

It wasn't long before tales of my deeds started to echo through the taverns and across the craggy peaks. They said I wrestled a cave troll into submission on the cliffs of [[Gorm’s End]]. And yeah, that happened, but they never tell you about the part where we ended up sharing a keg of ale afterward, laughing over the absurdity of our brawl. Then there was the time I dove into the [[Mirthless Lake]] to retrieve the [[Sunken Jewel of Elghinn]]. The water, dark and chilling to the bone, didn't bother me; my stone heart was immune to the lake’s icy grip. But the gratitude in the villagers’ eyes? That warmth reached into my very core.

These journeys, these challenges, they sculpted me. I was shaping my legacy, not with the expectation of others, but with my own hands. Yet, it was in the shadowed lands of [[Yinora]] where my path took an unexpected turn. [[Yinora]], a realm of perpetual twilight, its dark side teeming with creatures as vile as the night is long. It was there, amidst the darkness, that my purpose found me.

I stumbled upon a battlefield, the air thick with the stench of malice. The forces of evil, a horde born from [[Yinora]]’s dark heart, were a tide of shadows threatening to engulf the land. And there, standing against the tide, was a paladin, her armor alight with the fervor of battle. [[Iomedae]]. Her name wasn't known to me then - or to the world for that matter. But her courage? It was as clear as daylight in that dismal place.

Without a thought, I joined the fray. Stone and steel, we fought side by side. My fists, hardened by my journey, found their mark again and again. Beside me, Iomedae’s blade sung a song of valor, cutting swathes through our enemies. It wasn’t just a battle; it was a declaration. Together, we were a beacon in the dark, a testament to the power of standing united against the encroaching shadow.

In the aftermath, as the last of the dark creatures fled into the crevices from whence they came, Iomedae and I shared a moment of understanding. I complimented her sword skill, she cheered to the sturdiness of my knuckles. I declared me graced by her figure, she knocked me on the head.
But beneath the exhaustion, there was a spark, a recognition of shared purpose. She saw me, not as a legendary figure, or someone else's, but as a comrade. And in her, I saw the embodiment of the ideals I'd been searching for in my travels. Valor, justice, the will to fight for those who cannot.

That battle under the dark skies of [[Yinora]] wasn't just another tale for the bards. It was the moment I found my calling. Not as a ruler, or a hero for fame's sake, but as a guardian of rock standing against the darkness. My legacy, it turns out, wasn't just about the deeds I’d done or the battles I’d won. It was about finding my place in a world that was much bigger than the empire of [[Behl’Gurn]] or the confines of my father's expectations.

From stone to legend, my journey was mine alone, carved by the choices I made and the paths I chose to tread. And as I stood there, with Iomedae at my side, I realized that this—this right here—was exactly where I was meant to be.

My father didn't think so.

# His Unyielding Legacy
Returning from the darkened lands of [[Yinora]], my heart was alight with purpose and camaraderie. Iomedae and I had parted ways, but her spirit and the ideals she embodied remained with me, fueling my determination to carve a legacy true to my convictions. Yet, as I neared the gates of [[Behl’Gurn]], the weight of an unspoken truth began to press upon me like the mountains themselves.

It wasn’t long before the whispers of the court reached my ears, a murmured tale that twisted my insides more than any blade could. My father, Tora Ironfist, in his unwavering pursuit to secure the future of our lineage, had crafted a deception so elaborate, it threatened to undermine the very foundation of Behl’Gurn.

In the heart of our stone halls, a pact had been forged in secrecy, a false union between the Torasson and Guldnackarna of Baal. A child, not of my stone flesh but of flesh and blood, was paraded around as *my* child and heir— an heir born of manipulation and shadows, chosen by lot as if destiny could be drawn from a hat.

This revelation chiseled a rift between my father and me, wider than the deepest mines of Dur'Gurn. I was a son of stone, incapable of continuing our line in the traditional sense, but was the legacy I forged myself not enough for my father if it didn't include an heir? 

The implications of my father’s actions were as complex as the labyrinthine tunnels beneath our city. The child, innocent in this grand scheme, was now a pawn in a game of thrones, their fate intertwined with the power struggles of our empire. And the Guldnackarna of Baal, once allies bound by mutual respect and ambition, now held a claim to Behl’Gurn that threatened to destabilize our realm. And how had they even managed to convince my father you ask? By blackmail, I discovered, for they knew I couldn't father an heir, something my father couldn't let out publicly. I knew then that his shame for what I was was going to spell doom for our family.

I confronted my father. How could he, a dwarf of honor and strength, resort to such machinations? His answer was as hard and unyielding as the stone from which I was born, but its words left me conflicted. 

“For the kingdom, my son,” he said, his voice echoing in the stone halls, “For its future, for its people. A ruler must make decisions not with his heart, but with his mind. You, forged from my love and prayer, were never meant to be shackled by the burden of lineage, I realise. Your path is one of legend, not of the throne. This child will keep my lineage. You're free of it. Do as you will.”

And that was that. 

# My path
And so I returned to my path, striding back into the wild embrace of adventure. Each step was meant to be a declaration, a continuation of the legend I had started to etch across the land and in the hearts of those who heard my tales. But this time, the steps felt different. Lighter, yet somehow heavier. I was no longer a son in defiance, no longer a stone hurled against the fortress of my father’s expectations. I was free, yes, but freedom tasted different than I had imagined.

The world unfolded before me, vast and teeming with mysteries that called to my stone heart. I found myself wrestling with the great sea serpents in the Serpents Sea, their scales slippery under my grip, their might a thrilling challenge. The greatest battle of which ended in a pact, that dwarven ships would be protected in the sea as long as they sailed. A victory for all dwarves, surely, but still I wasn't satisfied. So I set out again. 

I explored ancient ruins that whispered secrets of a world before ours, their voices echoing through corridors untrodden by dwarven boots for centuries or millennia - who knew? I delved deep, guided by the flickering torchlight, uncovering relics that hummed with the essence of creation. These were moments of awe, solitary but for the shadows that danced along the walls, painting tales of forgotten epochs. One of these ruins, beneath a southern rock on the volcanic island of Ashenfell, I found paintings of ancient heroes. Fighting alongside each other to save the world, I was reminded what I saw in that paladin's eyes so many years ago.

I ventured on still, determined that what I was looking for was just a stone-throw away. It wasn't, though that didn't stop the god of the forge to challenge me. He'd heard of my tales, and wondered if I could stone-toss the distance they had spread. He infused me with godly power, and the result of our contest is what you would know today as the stone-toss islands. I hear they have magical mushroom cocktails.

I had undoubtedly etched my way into legend, proven my valor beyond doubt without anybody's help or privilege. I was at the top of the mountain. What more could a dwarf want? 

Returning to Ashenfell, the place had become quite the center for sea-farers over the years, I found part of the answer. It was here I met a pirate captain, his spirit as untamed as the seas he navigated. Captain Sablehawk, he called himself, his laugh as loud as the cannons that adorned his ship. In his crew, a rag-tag assembly of souls each with their own tales of defiance and dreams of treasure, I found a semblance of the camaraderie I longed for. I fell in love with this group, and the island itself. But still the memory of that paladin was etched in my mind, her look, the force of her fist upon my head when I gave her mine. I needed to find her.

# Not a heart of stone

With the call of adventure once more ringing in my ears, I set out for Lohaven, a land where the churches of men stood as individual cities. The city of Refuge, the original city of men, was snuck inside a cliffy cliffy ravine along the coastline. It was here, amidst the winding streets and towering spires, that I sought the paladin who had once stood beside me in the shadowed lands of Yinora.

Refuge was a bustling metropolis, its streets filled with traders, pilgrims, and adventurers. As I walked through its crowded markets and past its grand temples, I felt a sense of anticipation building within me. It had been many years, and I had surely experienced much since then. Had she? Would she still be the same paladin whose courage and valor had inspired me so deeply?

I found her in one of Refuge's grand temples, a towering edifice dedicated to Sarenrae. Iomedae was a paladin of Sarenrae, but hers (and her increasingly large amount of follower's) interpretation of the goddess's ideals was unique. She and They focused on proactive healing, believing that slaying evil was a form of preventing greater harm. As I approached the temple, I noticed her among a group of her followers looking at her with admiration. I admired also, but while others had their eyes on her ideals, I had my eyes on her. Besides her curves, I noticed her shield and sword, powerful magical relics that seemed to hum with energy.

We spoke for hours, sharing tales of our journeys and our dreams. Iomedae spoke of her aspirations, her desire to reach beyond what anyone had achieved, to embody all that was valorous and honorable. As I listened, I felt a pang of conflict within me. Her path was much like the one I had walked, a path I had discovered wasn't worth pursuing for its own sake. You needed to find the people worth fighting for, the cause worth dedicating yourself to. Yet, I couldn't bring myself to voice these thoughts, my hope for love tying my tongue.

**Suddenly, the sky above us cracked**, catching fire as a ball of flame streaked across the heavens. The meteor struck the inner sea with a thunderous impact. Messages from the gods quickly followed, projected into the minds of their high-ranking priests and paladins, urging them to seek out the source of this celestial disturbance. The perceptive among us realized that even the gods were taken by surprise, unsure of what had just occurred. Hours later, Refuge's outer cliffs were hit by a devastating tsunami.

In the aftermath of the chaos, Iomedae and I set out to find the impact site. We sailed into the inner sea, where we discovered broken mountains floating in the sky, crashing together randomly and violently. Boulders and debris rained down on our ship as we navigated the treacherous waters below. In the center of this maelstrom floated a glowing orb of light, constantly bashed and bounced around by the floating mountains.

No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't catch the orb. It slipped through our grasp time and again, evading our every effort. Iomedae turned to me, her eyes filled with resolve.

"Sorry, Durgan, but my lady Dawnflower commands me to investigate. And I don't mean to intrude, but this boat is too heavy."

As she spoke, her shield and sword began to glow, and from her back, two radiant, feathery wings sprouted. With a powerful beat, she took flight, leaving me on the deck of the ship. My heart, like the rest of me, felt heavy as a rock. Finally happiness within my grasp, and she slipped away like a white dove on feathered wings. The feelings swept over me like the eminent tsunami - Perhaps it was my existence coming to curse me again? Knowing only the coldness of the rock, never the soft warmth of skin on skin. Crafted for someone else's legacy and having spent a lifetime carving my own - I felt hollowed out. I craved to fill that hole with the love I yearned, but she flew away on those white wings, unturned. 

I felt as if I'd hit rock bottom, but irony (debris) struck and sent me sunk. Sinking face up, I saw the light slowly fading. I had ample time to reflect on it all. 

The water enveloped me, cold and unyielding. My stone body, dense and unbreakable, dragged me deeper into the abyss.  The surface shimmered above me, growing fainter with each passing moment. I had been forged from stone, yet in this moment of despair, I felt more fragile than ever.

Above, Iomedae soared toward the heavens, her radiant wings a beacon of hope and valor. Below, I sank into the dark embrace of the sea, a stark contrast to her ascension. As I descended, memories of my journey flickered through my mind like the faintest glimmers of light piercing the deep. The battles fought, the friends made, and the legends carved. Yet, in this moment of solitude, one truth became clear: the most important part of my journey had been the people I shared it with. It wasn't the deeds, the glory or the purpose instilled upon us by those who think themselves taller; it was the bonds forged in the fires of adversity and camaraderie. Yet I wasn't able to make her truly see. 

With a final thud, I hit the seabed, the impact sending sandy ripples through the water. The darkness was complete, but within it, I found a strange solace. My journey had brought me full circle, back to the firm and cold darkness from which I was born. And like that boat upon the sea, I had defied my nature and willed myself afloat, but only for so long. I sat still on the rocky seabed, enduring, and understood the true value of the life I had carved out. In those moments, I accepted my place. I was not meant for the lofty ideals of heaven, but for the grounded, enduring connections of the earth.

I stood, and I sought them out. Those villagers at the mirthless lake. The traders of the inner sea. My friends, the captain and his crew. I mourned the poor souls of Gorm's end, their home obliterated by the meteor. I even visited my father a final time, he seemed more content now that the young prince showed great prospects for his legacy. And I continued to journey the world, and made new connections. Connections that would transcend a lifetime.
